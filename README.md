# Hamoye-Internship
## Stage A: Introduction to Python for machine learning
Worked on a dataset from [FAO](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Introduction-to-Python-for-machine-learning/files/7768140/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv) to attempt the quiz questions.  
It was a refresher course on Python programming; a good place to start before moving to more complex tasks.
## Stage B: Becoming a Data Storyteller
There was no project involving coding. Topics covered include: 
* Introduction to technical writing, 
* How to create reports from visualization, 
* Introduction to visualization libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas profiling,
* Introduction to PowerBI for visualizations.  
I learnt about planning your writing, understanding the final user, choosing the right visuals, and overall report presentation.
## Stage C: Python Libraries for Storytelling
This was a more detailed exploration of the visualization libraries with a little icing on top - web scraping.  
You'll find the folder for the datasets, notebook, and report in the `stage C` folder. I chose to work on COVID-19 dataset and its relationship with the Nigerian economy.
## Stage D: Data Storytelling in Pattern Recognition
This stage showed a data analysis project on FAO datasets using Wolfram Language. The task was to replicate some or all of the codes and get the corresponding visualizations. The project is in the `Stage D` branch in this repo. 
## Stage E: Data Curation for Storytelling
Toughest stage throughout the course. Project is on `Stage E` branch in this repo.
## Comments...
It was 4 months of learning and building. I enjoyed some parts of the capstone and premier projects because of the collaboration and the privilege of actually asking questions and getting detailed answers (occasionally) from more experienced interns who understood the *stress* of the internship.  
I'm looking forward to putting the skills to good use.
