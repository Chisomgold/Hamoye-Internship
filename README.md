# Stage E Data curation
The project was about data disovery, retrieval, quality management, and a couple of other steps that I probably missed.
This was, hands down, the toughest stage for me. It required data extraction from both PDFs and HTML documents to CSV. At least, that's what I think since there was no precise instructions. I had to choose between Coca cola data (https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/financial-information/financial-results) and a webpage from Amazon search (https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amazon+shopping+online&rh=n%3A283155&dc&adgrpid=84486094307&gclid=CjwKCAjwwab7BRBAEiwAapqpTDYtTN8aym2q_rlYn1VdmofKw0_bzkd6xjaCl8cMY4syjbPZMKNMjxoCLIYQAvD_BwE&hvadid=393524136919&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1010294&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=2170543926145783317&hvtargid=kwd-469356929&hydadcr=22365_10729094&qid=1600780278&rnid=2941120011&tag=hydglogoo-20&ref=sr_nr_n_10).  Normally, I'd have picked Amazon, cos, you know, books - writer - me, but I couldn't figure out what informaton was useful and how to extract them early enough. However, I chose the Coca Cola task since it was somewhat easier to extract tables from documents.
## Steps followed
* Data extraction from the coca cola website (Most were in Excel format)
* Data organization in Excel, by Quarter by Year, which is what you'll find in the Excel Sheets.
* Data cleaning, still on Excel. I had filter out or rename some headings for uniformity across the years and quarter
* Loading datasets into Jupyter notebook
* Data exploration and further cleaning (EDA).

I'm going to need an indepth session on data curation if I'm going to get it right.
Thank you for reading.
